        <h3><span>01</span> The problem</h3>
        <p>Acting as a caregiver for several people, I wished I had a more efficient tool to track symptom details so I could better communicate with healthcare professionals during the brief face-to-face appointments.</p>
        <h3><span>02</span> The solution</h3>
        <p>SymPath, an iOS app, empowers the user to record symptom details that are important to healthcare providers. Based on insight derived from user research, the app allows the user to choose between two paths so she can customize her experience and determine the type of detail she wants to collect.</p>

        <h3><span>03</span> The process</h3>
        <h4>Research to determine need and value</h4>
        <p>I had a need. And having spent more than 300 hours assisting in hospitals as a nursing student, I felt I had insight to build a useful tool. I knew the assessment questions that healthcare professionals ask to collect the data needed to make diagnoses and care plans.</p>
        <p>So, my challenges were:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> to find out if other people had a need for such an app, and if so, </li>
          <li>to build a tool that empowered users to record meaningful data, allowing them to be engaged participants in their own health care.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><span class="boldIt">Uncover user needs:</span> I asked people if they ever tracked symptoms (75% did) and how they did it (57% claimed to remember details unaided).</p>
        <p>I was envious of their abilities. I could never seem to remember how many weeks it had been since that tumble that caused a fracture, or the names of the last three specialists we had seen and the different tests ordered.</p>
        <p>But, a follow-up question revealed some cracks. When asked what details were harder to remember, 57% fessed up to struggling to remember specific dates and duration of symptoms. 52% admitted they forgot the questions they intended to ask the doctor. And 43% struggled to describe how their symptoms had changed over time.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">Market research to guide product design:</span> To understand the competition, I downloaded symptom-tracking and notepad apps. I found existing apps were designed around either one specific symptom (pain) or a specific cluster of medical conditions (such as digestive problems). There appeared to be a gap in the market for an app allowing the user to customize their symptom tracking, so this is where I started to build.</p>

        <h4>Wayfinding: creating, testing, and refining 2 paths</h4>
        <p>Research directed us to personify 2 main types of users: an occasional and a frequent user based on her health concerns. User stories based on user research, paved the way to an app offering 2 pathways: basic and guided.</p>

          <p class="callout">Here, we're taking a slight detour to discuss the visual design decisions before refocusing on the successive usability tests that guided product refinement as we moved the prototype from low-fidelity to high-fidelity. Visual design decisions were made concurrently and implemented during the same timeframe we were conducting usability tests.</p>
        </div>


        <h4>Visual Design: wilderness navigation as a guiding metaphor</h4>

        <p>Knowing that illness can make a person feel lost in the woods, I found wilderness navigation, or orienteering, a helpful guiding metaphor during product development. So, when it came time to name the app and give it a visual identity, I kept heading in the same direction.</p>

        <p>Trying to communicate the uniqueness of a person’s experience of symptoms, I explored the similarities between a fingerprint and a topographic map. And, I sketched and tested other navigational symbols such as maps and compasses.</p>
        <img src="img/sym/sevolution.svg" alt="" class="indent">

        <p><span class="boldIt">In the end, the blending of a stethoscope-like shape with an orienteering path symbol to make an "S" ultimately performed best during preference testing as it reinforced both the product name and purpose.</span></p>

        <img src="/img/sym/faces.svg" alt="faces to help rate pain" width="400" class="indent">
        <p>Other visual design decisions included creating friendly, understandable icons to assist with data collection on assessment screens, such as creating faces for the pain scale, based on accepted Wong-Baker FACES scale.</p>

            <p><span class="boldIt">Revised design:</span> Instead of asking user to understand terms and customize their experience, users are guided through all assessment pieces with a Next button allowing users to easily bypass screens.

        <h3><span>04</span> What I learned</h3>
        <p><span class="boldIt">Get to the point.</span> Hitting the right amount of detail on onboarding screens takes work. During usability testing, I repeatedly observed testers resist reading even brief text that would help them better understand the product. To make onboarding as successful as possible, I wrote and re-wrote the introductory text and added icons to help communicate the difference between the 2 paths. In the end, animating some app screens combined with the refined, brief text, proved most successful in shaping a user’s understanding of the 2 pathways.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">Ask questions that reveal reality.</span> In talking with people during the initial survey and later usability testing, I aimed to ask questions that enabled me to understand their life as they experienced it. I wanted to learn about their actions and their habits, rather than their opinions. I found “The Mom Test: How to talk to customers and learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you” by Rob Fitzpatrick an excellent guide.</p>
        <p><span class="boldIt">Usability testing pays off.</span> Nothing beats a user reaction to confirm that the work was worth it. "I would have loved to have had something like this after my car accident. I tried to write everything down but it got hard after a while to remember and document everything."</p>
